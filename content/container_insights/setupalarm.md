#### CloudWatch Alarms

The metrics captured through Container Insights can be used to setup Alarms to get notified of any anomalies in the environment behavior.

In CloudWatch Container Insights weâ€™re going to drill down to create an alarm using CloudWatch for CPU Utilization for our application. Select **ECS Services** and click on the three vertical dots in the upper right of the CPU Utilization box. And select **View in Metrics**.

This will take you to a screen such as the one below. You can see that the **ecsdemo-frontend** service had its CPU Utilization spike quite a bit. Let's go ahead and setup an Alarm on this metric by clicking the ðŸ””icon corresponding to **ecsdemo-frontend** line item.

In the **Specify metric conditions** screen, leave everything as default and enter **50** in the **Define the threshold value** screen. By doing this, we are setting the CPU Utilization threshold for the alarm to be 50%. Select **Next**
