We have:

- Deployed a three tier polyglot application using industry best practices
- Centralized logs for each microservice to CloudWatchLogs
- Configured our infrastructure as code using CloudFormation
- Used the ecs-cli to deploy using AWS best practices built in
- NOT deployed a single server to configure, manage, patch, or reboot!
