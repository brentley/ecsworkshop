We will use Vagrant in order to create a virtual machine and install all the required artifacts before running the workloads.

### Vagrant

Vagrant is an open-source software product for building and maintaining portable virtual software development environments; e.g., for VirtualBox, KVM, Hyper-V, Docker containers, VMware, and AWS. It tries to simplify the software configuration management of virtualization in order to increase development productivity, read more about it [here](https://www.vagrantup.com/).

A `Vagrant` file is used to orchestrate what goes inside these VMs. Part of this workshop a sample `Vagrant` file is available part of the root directory which creates a virtual machine with the below configurations:

* OS -  ubuntu-20.0
* Memory - 2048 MB
* CPU - 2
* Port forwarding - Host Port 80 and Target port 80

Here is how the Vagrant file looks like:

```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
    config.vm.box = "bento/ubuntu-20.04"
    config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 8080, host: 8080
    config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
      vb.memory = 2048
      vb.cpus = 2
    end
end
```

> Note: You can choose another `host: <port>` if 8080 is not available on your host

### Create VM

1. Create a Vagrant VM, by running the following command from root directory (where `Vagrant` file is placed):

    ```bash
    #Launch Vagrant 
    vagrant up
    ```

    **Output**

    ```bash
    Bringing machine 'default' up with 'virtualbox' provider...
    ==> default: Importing base box 'bento/ubuntu-20.04'...
    ==> default: Matching MAC address for NAT networking...
    ==> default: Checking if box 'bento/ubuntu-20.04' version '202012.23.0' is up to date...
    ==> default: Setting the name of the VM: ecs-a_default_1620457707052_37629
    ==> default: Clearing any previously set network interfaces...
    ==> default: Preparing network interfaces based on configuration...
        default: Adapter 1: nat
    ==> default: Forwarding ports...
        default: 8080 (guest) => 8080 (host) (adapter 1)
        default: 22 (guest) => 2222 (host) (adapter 1)
    ==> default: Running 'pre-boot' VM customizations...
    ==> default: Booting VM...
    ==> default: Waiting for machine to boot. This may take a few minutes...
        default: SSH address: 127.0.0.1:2222
        default: SSH username: vagrant
        default: SSH auth method: private key
        default:
        default: Vagrant insecure key detected. Vagrant will automatically replace
        default: this with a newly generated keypair for better security.
        default:
        default: Inserting generated public key within guest...
        default: Removing insecure key from the guest if it's present...
        default: Key inserted! Disconnecting and reconnecting using new SSH key...
    ==> default: Machine booted and ready!
    ==> default: Checking for guest additions in VM...
    ==> default: Mounting shared folders...
        default: /vagrant => /Users/harrajag/CodeBase/ecs-a
    ```

2. Run the following command to ssh into the newly created virtual machine

    ```bash
    # ssh to vagrant box
    vagrant ssh
    ```

    **Output**

    ```bash
    Welcome to Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS (GNU/Linux 5.4.0-58-generic x86_64)

### Install required software on Vagrant vm

1. Run the following command to setup the ECS-anywhere activation ID and code thats required for running the install

    ```bash
    # Run all commands on the vagrant machine
    export ACTIVATION_ID=<<ACTIVATION_ID>>
    export ACTIVATION_CODE=<<ACTIVATION_CODE>>
    ```

    > Note: Replace `ACTIVATION_ID` and `ACTIVATION_CODE` with the actual values available inside `ssm-activation.json` file of the host machine

2. Download ECS-anywhere install shell script, update permissions and check the integrity of the file before proceeding to next step

    ```bash
    # Download the ecs-anywhere install Script 
    curl --proto "https" -o "/tmp/ecs-anywhere-install.sh" "https://amazon-ecs-agent.s3.amazonaws.com/ecs-anywhere-install-latest.sh"
    ```

3. Run the following command to install `ECS agent` and `SSM agent` which will allow ECS control plane to manage and run workloads on this virtual machine

    ```bash
    # Run the install script
    sudo bash /tmp/ecs-anywhere-install.sh \
        --cluster test-ecs-anywhere \
        --activation-id $ACTIVATION_ID \
        --activation-code $ACTIVATION_CODE \
        --region us-east-1 
    ```

    > Note: Make sure to update `--region` parameter to reflect the AWS region in which ECS cluster has been created

    **Output**

    ```bash
    .......
    Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/ecs.service â†’ /lib/systemd/system/ecs.service.

    # ok
    ##########################
    ```

4. Verify whether the virtual box is connected to ECS control plane and its up and running by executing the following commands.

{{% notice note %}}
First run exit command to exit the virtual machine and run the below commands in the host machine
{{% /notice %}}

```bash
aws ssm describe-instance-information
aws ecs list-container-instances --cluster $CLUSTER_NAME
```

**Output for #1**
