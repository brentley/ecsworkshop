## Amazon ECS Workshop for AWS Fargate

![3-service-animated](images/3-service-animated.gif)

In this workshop, we will configure GitHub, CodePipeline, CodeBuild, VPC, ALB, ECS,
Autoscaling, and log aggregation using a framework called [Mu](https://getmu.io) to
launch microservices on AWS Elastic Container Service.

We will launch a frontend, and multiple backend services and will explore how you
might adopt this workflow in your environment.
