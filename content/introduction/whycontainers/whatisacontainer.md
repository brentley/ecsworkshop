- Containers provide a standard way to package your application's code, configurations, and dependencies into a single object. 
- Containers share an operating system installed on the server and run as resource-isolated processes, ensuring quick, reliable, and consistent deployments, regardless of environment.
- Whether you deploy locally on your laptop or to production, the experience will remain the same (with the exception of secrets and other environmental values, of course!).
