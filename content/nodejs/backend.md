Letâ€™s bring up the Node.js Backend API!

Copy/Paste the following commands into your Cloud9 workspace:

```
cd ~/environment/ecsdemo-nodejs
mu pipeline up -t $GITHUB_TOKEN
```

{{% notice info %}}
The output will include warning lines about IAM. These can be safely ignored
since we aren't building the environment with this pipeline.
{{% /notice %}}

{{% notice tip %}}
This will take 5 minutes to create the pipeline.
{{% /notice %}}

After the CodePipeline is built, [watch it run.](https://console.aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/home?region=us-east-1#/view/)

You can watch the pipeline steps in the terminal:
```
mu svc show -w -t
```

You can also follow the pipeline logs:
```
mu pipeline logs -f
```

And follow the task logs:
```
mu svc logs -f acceptance
```
